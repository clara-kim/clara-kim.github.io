    <!--General details about the project.-->
    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>September-December, 2019</p>
    <p>You In? is an app that aims to make it easier for friends to plan meetups.</p>
    <p>Basically, it works by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Users sharing their available free times (“events”) along with details they might want to do during that time (e.g., meals, drinks, study buddy).</li>
        <li>Users seeing and joining their friend’s “events” if they’re available.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You In? is a mobile application developed as a team project throughout a Human-Computer Interaction course.</p>
    <p>Framework Used: NativeScript+Vue</p>
    
    <h1>Research and Analysis</h1>
    
    <h3>Defining the Problem</h3>
    <p>It’s difficult to find time to get together with friends. The issue is exacerbated by highly variable schedules and the inability to easily communicate one's free time to each of one's friends.</p>
    
    <h3>Reviewing Existing Research</h3>
    <p>Research in the field of shared calendars has mostly been restricted to calendars shared within families or workplaces, instead of friendships. Bødker and  Grönvall summarize the three core uses of family calendars: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Coordination and Negotiation: to work out a shared understanding of what, when and by whom something should be performed,</li>
        <li>Review and reminders: to provide an overview (short-term and future) of what activities will take place and act as a to-do list and finally</li>
        <li>Awareness: provide and understand what other people within a family are doing and where.</li>
    </ol>
   <p>Our project will primarily focus on the third use (awareness). We want to make it easy for users to see when their friends are available and to easily find time to meet. The secondary purpose of our project would be the first use (coordination and negotiation). Following awareness of available times to meet, we would like our users to be able to decide what to do during that time. Our project will splinter from the second use (review and reminders) as events posted will not serve as a traditional posting on a calendar (eg. a family dinner or office meeting you must attend). Instead posted events will serve more as open invitations to whoever is willing and available to join.</p>
