            <p>You In? is an app that aims to make it easier for friends to plan meetups.</p>
            <p>Basically, it works by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Users sharing their available free times (“events”) along with details they might want to do during
                    that time (e.g., meals, drinks, study buddy).</li>
                <li>Users seeing and joining their friend’s “events” if they’re available.</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            <h5> Who did it?</h5>
            <p>A team of 4 throughout a human-computer interaction (HCI) course</p>

        <p class="col-sm-8">It’s difficult to find time to get together with friends. The issue is exacerbated by highly

        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>Research in the field of shared calendars has mostly been restricted to calendars shared within families
                or workplaces, instead of friendships. Bødker and  Grönvall summarize the three core uses of family
                calendars: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Coordination and Negotiation: to work out a shared understanding of what, when and by whom
                    something should be performed,</li>
                <li>Review and reminders: to provide an overview (short-term and future) of what activities will take
                    place and act as a to-do list and finally</li>
                <li>Awareness: provide and understand what other people within a family are doing and where.</li>
            </ol>
           <p>Our project will primarily focus on the third use (awareness). We want to make it easy for users to see
               when their friends are available and to easily find time to meet. The secondary purpose of our project
               would be the first use (coordination and negotiation). Following awareness of available times to meet,
               we would like our users to be able to decide what to do during that time. Our project will splinter from
               the second use (review and reminders) as events posted will not serve as a traditional posting on a
               calendar (eg. a family dinner or office meeting you must attend). Instead posted events will serve more
               as open invitations to whoever is willing and available to join.</p>

            <p>We found that shared calendars are often cluttered and unreadable as well as a privacy issue when forced
                to share one's entire agenda. Meanwhile, most users consider event invites to be too formal and
                inflexible for planning laidback hangout sessions.</p>

                suited for time management purposes and the single card view was too slow to navigate and difficult
                to track down specific

                more specific icon on each page (e.g., a calendar with a +-sign for adding an event and a person
                with a +-sign to add a friend). We also changed the background of the button to make it clear it was

                that “Hosting” is representative of the page and easily understood by users due to familiarity.</li>
